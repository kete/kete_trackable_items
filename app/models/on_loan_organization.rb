# quote from spec: When archives are tracked to “On Loan” additional information is required i.e. to what organization / office they will be loaned to.  This is a list that will need to be maintained by Staff as it could be continually added to. This list may need to be separate for each Archives Repository as to prevent clutter for the other councils.

  validates_uniqueness_of :name, :case_sensitive => false
